# Nmap-Scan
This was a Nmap Scan created using virtualized versions of Kali Linux and Ubuntu.

## Objective
The Nmap-Scan project aimed to ensure a connection between two virtualized systems (Kali Linux & Ubuntu, both virtualized through VMWare Fusion Pro. After establishing a controlled virtualization environment, this project enables the user to ensure roper connectivity and responsiveness by simulating an attack on one's home network, which allows the user to identify the attack, and defend against it in real-time, also allowing for real-time system and network hardening. 

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of virtualization workspaces such as Kali Linux and Ubuntu.
- Enhancement of Bash Language syntax recognition.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.


### Tools Used

- Virtualization System (VMWare Fusion Pro) for setting up a lab testing enviornment.
- Network analysis tools (Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
